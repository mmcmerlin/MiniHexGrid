The Mini Hex Grid consists of hexagon-shaped modules (100mm diagonal), which interconnect to form a visual and interactive tabletop model of an electricity grid. The ongoing transition to sustainable energy across multiple sectors is putting a lot of pressure on the energy sector, which needs to be tremendously upgraded, especially as our society needs to meet ambitious, yet necessary, targets such as those of the Paris agreements.

Each module represents a different part of the electricity grid (such as thermal generator, wind farm, transmission lines, load industries, or city distribution networks) and all the modules work together to distributively solve a simulated phasor power flow system. Each module then uses embedded visual cues (addressable LEDs, a small LCD display, a rotary encoder, and a servo motor) to demonstrate the working of the particular elements of the grid, e.g. rotating wind turbines, illuminated houses, animated train stations. The potential catalogue of the Mini Hex Grid Demonstrator will eventually include a solar farm, pumped hydro, microgrid, high-voltage direct-current converter, and more..

Presently, the Mini Hex Grid is in its version 2.1 of hardware and version 1.1 of software.
