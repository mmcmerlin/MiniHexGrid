# The Mini Hex Grid
## About
The Mini Hex Grid is a set of interconnected hexagonal modules (100mm diagonal), which form a visual and interactive tabletop model of an electricity grid. The ongoing transition to sustainable energy across multiple sectors is putting a lot of pressure on the energy sector, which needs to be tremendously upgraded, especially as our society needs to meet ambitious, yet necessary, targets such as those of the Paris agreements.

## Hex Modules
Individual modules can represent many different parts of the electricity grid (such as thermal generators, wind farms, transmission lines, load industries, or city distribution networks). When connected, the modules distributively solve a simulated phasor power flow system. Each module then uses embedded external interfaces (addressable LEDs, a small LCD display, a rotary encoder, and a servo motor) to visually convey information to the user, e.g. rotating wind turbines, illuminated houses, animated train stations. The Mini Hex Grid has the potential to include a large catalogue of modules including, but not limited to a solar farm, pumped hydro, microgrid, high-voltage direct-current converter, and more...

Presently, the Mini Hex Grid is in its version 2.1 of hardware and version 1.1 of software.
